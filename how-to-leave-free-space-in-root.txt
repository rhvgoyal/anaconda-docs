		How to leave free space in root volume group
		--------------------------------------------

Primarily there are two methods to leave free space in root volume group. One
can use interactive graphical installation or one can use a kickstart file
to control the installation.

Interactive Graphical Install
----------------------------
- Start Graphical Installation

- Click on "Installation Destination"

- On next screen under "Other Storage Options/Partitionig" select
  "I will configure partitioning".

- On next screen click on "Click here to create them automatically". This
  will create a default partitioning scheme.

- Click on "/". And this will show default "Desired Capacity" on right.

- Reduce that capacity to leave some free space in root volume group.

- By default root volume group is big enough to accomodate user created
  volumes. Any free space on disk is left free and is not part of volume
  group. Change that by clicking on "Modify" and selecting "Size policy"
  as "As large as possible". Click on "Save".

  This should make sure that any unused space on disk is left free in root
  volume group.

- Click on "Done"

- Accept proposed partitioning.

- Click on "Begin Installation"

Use a kickstart file
--------------------
One can use a kickstart file to create custom partitions. kickstart option
"volgroup" provides options "--reserved-percent" and "--reserved-space" where
one can specify how much space to leave free in volume group.

Following is a smaple portion of kickstart which can be used to leave 20%
free space in root volume group.

# Disk partitioning information
part /boot --size=500
part pv.1 --size=500 --grow
volgroup rhel --pesize=4096 pv.1 --reserved-percent=20
logvol /  --size=500 --grow --name=root --vgname=rhel
logvol swap --size=2048 --name=swap --vgname=rhel
